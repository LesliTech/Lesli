# Lesli

**Lesli** is a **SaaS Development Framework** designed to help you build highly scalable, secure, and customizable software products with ease.

It’s built on top of industry-proven technologies like **Ruby on Rails**, **PostgreSQL**, **Hotwire**, **Bulma**, **SASS**, **AlpineJS** and many other fantastic open-source libraries, gems, and tools.

Lesli provides a robust set of built-in features and a standard process for extending its capabilities through modules, making it easy to create your own custom components when needed.

> Lesli goes beyond being just a starter kit or boilerplate. It’s a Ruby on Rails-based core gem that enables you to build modular applications (a.k.a. engines) by leveraging its built-in features, generators, components, and industry best practices. With Lesli, you can easily extend existing functionality or develop fully customized solutions tailored to your specific needs.

## Why Lesli?

Lesli is **fully open source** and comes packed with tools and features that can save you months of development time. Thanks to its modular architecture, you can seamlessly extend Lesli’s functionality by adding pre-built modules — allowing you to get your SaaS product up and running in minutes.

Lesli is published under the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)**. This means you’re free to use, copy, redistribute, and/or modify Lesli, as long as you comply with the terms of the GPL.

## How Does It Work?

**Lesli was built with modularity and extensibility at its core.** 
Need task management? Just install the Tasks module. 
Want an event calendar? There’s a module for that too. 
Looking to add a comment system to your blog? Simply inherit from the base controller. 

There are several ways to take advantage of Lesli’s features:

- **Install official modules** directly through gems.
- **Extend existing functionality** by inheriting from Lesli controllers and models.
- **Integrate specific features** into your app via service objects.
- **Leverage Lesli as an API-first backend** for your web or mobile applications.

## Ruby on Rails

By using Rails as its foundation, Lesli benefits from Rails’ mature ecosystem, conventions, and built-in features. Rails simplifies common tasks such as routing, database management, and user authentication, allowing developers to focus on building the core functionalities of their SaaS applications more efficiently.
