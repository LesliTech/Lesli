# Installation

Lesli is a Ruby on Rails gem designed to integrate seamlessly into your application. It keeps its code, database, and assets fully isolated, ensuring it wonâ€™t interfere with your main app. This isolation allows you to extend functionality without adding complexity or risking conflicts within your core codebase.


> **Before You Start:** Make sure you have **Ruby 3.2.x**, **Rails 8.0.x** and NodeJS 20.x (to work with LesliAssets) installed on your system.


## Create a New Rails Application

To get started, generate a fresh Ruby on Rails app. This will serve as the base for integrating Lesli.

```bash
rails new LesliApp
```


### Install the Lesli Core

```bash
bundle add lesli
```

> Or clone the repository for [development](https://www.lesli.dev/engines/lesli/getting-started/development/)


Check that Lesli is correctly installed and accessible by running:

```bash
rake lesli:status
```

>This will output the current status of the Lesli framework and confirm that it's properly wired into your application.


### Set Up Lesli

After installing the gem, run the Lesli installation generator to configure the required files and routes:

```bash
rails generate lesli:install
```

This command will:

- Generate a new initializer file at config/initializers/lesli.rb where you can customize core Lesli settings and behaviors.
- Mount all Lesli engine routes by injecting the following into your config/routes.rb file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
    Lesli::Routing.mount
end
```

Also is going to create a lesli.rb initializer file to customize the Lesli options


Lesli provides a convenient Rake task to set up a fully functional database for development and demo purposes.

Run the following command:

```bash
rake lesli:db:dev
```

This task will:

- Run all database migrations 
- Build privileges (if LesliSecurity is installed) 
- Import translation files (if LesliBabel is installed) 
- Seed demo users and sample data for every installed engine 
- Output a summary with the current application status 
- You can restart your database to start with a new fresh database 

<br>

To reset your environment and start from a clean state, run:

```bash
rake lesli:db:reset 
```
>This command will drop, create, migrate, and re-seed the database using the same logic as lesli:db:dev, Useful when testing or debugging your development setup.


Start the default Rails development server:

```shell
rails s 
rails s --binding=0.0.0.0
rails s --environment=test
rails s --environment=development
RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true rails s --environment=production 
```

Using your favorite web browser, navigate to: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/login" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:3000/login</a>

<lesli-browser host="http://localhost:3000/" url="">
    <img src="../images/screenshot-welcome.png">
</lesli-browser>

You should now see the Lesli welcome page ðŸŽ‰

### Recommendations

To improve your local development experience with Lesli, consider the following:

- **Use `letter_opener` for Local Email Preview**

<br>

Install the `letter_opener` gem in your `Gemfile` under the development group:

```ruby
group :development do
    gem 'letter_opener'
end
```

Then configure your config/environments/development.rb:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

This allows you to preview emails in your browser instead of sending them during development.
