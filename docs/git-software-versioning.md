# Software versioning
Following the semantic versioning spec helps other developers who depend on your code understand the extent of changes in a given version, and adjust their own code if necessary.



## Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

| Code status   | Stage         | Rule              | Example 
|-              |-              |-                  |-
| First release | New product   | Start with 1.0.0  | 1.0.0
| Backward compatible bug fixes | Patch release     | Increment the third digit | 1.0.1
| Backward compatible new features | Minor release  | Increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero | 1.1.0
| Changes that break backward compatibility | Major release | Increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero | 2.0.0
