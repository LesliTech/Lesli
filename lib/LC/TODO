The current version of LC::Date does not support settings nor multiple accounts. It must be implemented.

The things to consider are the following:
- LC::Date must be transparent, so a call to any method should contain as little information as possible
   (idealy, only the date to be formatted)
- ApplcationLesliController already saves the date settins in every request, so a way to store them into a global variable and
   use them in LC::Date would be perfect (however, we don't know yet how that would be done)
- At the current time, the only format available is the default format (this is only for the backend, the frontend already works with the db values)

Things we have already tried:
   - Usings settings is not possible (the variable is only available in controllers and views)
   - Sending variables throught Thread.current is not consistent and it's behavior is unpredictable, besides, we need a way to give the information from Jobs and Tasks
