// · This file is needed due SASS does not support conditional imports, so, to allow customization
// · based on the existance of "customization" files, what we do is to check if customization file
// · exists then we return the SASS path for that file if not, we return the path to this file then
// · in this way we avoid non-existance errors from SASS.

// · For details check the code in: lib/LC/system/info.rb:95
