I have it. They don\'t. This bothers them.","No weapons, no friends, no hope. Take all that away, and what\'s left? Me.","I\'m the thing that monsters have nightmares about.","Strong is fighting. It\'s hard and it\'s painful, and it\'s every day. It\'s what we have to do. And we can do it together.","I\'m beyond tired. I\'m beyond scared. I\'m standing on the mouth of hell, and it\'s gonna swallow me whole. And it\'ll choke on me. We\'re not ready? They\'re not ready.","There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil. And that\'s us.","So what — are we helpless puppets? No. The big moments are gonna come. You can\'t help that. It\'s what you do afterwards that counts. That\'s when you find out who you are.","When it\'s really something that matters, they fight. I mean, they\'re lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never— they never quit. And so I guess I will keep fighting, too.","If the apocalypse comes, beep me.","The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.","In every generation there is a chosen one. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the slayer.","I may be dead, but I\'m still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.","Cordelia, your mouth is open, sound is coming from it. This is never good.","Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the Homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad... you suck.","They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.","I don\'t know what\'s coming next. But I do know it\'s gonna be just like this.","Well, I like you. You\'re nice, and you\'re funny, and you don\'t smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but... that\'s not all the time. I mean, three days out of the month, I\'m not much fun to be around either.","A good Sunnydale rule-of-thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.","I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you\'d like to watch... I mean, that\'s what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching?","I\'m talking! Don\'t interrupt me! Insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and make your worst fears come true. Okay?","Just because you\'re better than us doesn\'t mean you can be all superior.","You should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. You know, that\'s, uh, that\'s actually some pretty good advice.","A vampire isn\'t a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it took over, but it\'s a demon at the core. There is no halfway.","I\'m leaning towards blind panic myself.","Well, I\'m a hair\'s breath from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I\'m open to anything.","Buffy, what you said, it flies in the face of everything we\'ve ever... every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it\'s bloody brilliant.","Now, I know you haven\'t been in the game for a while, mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d\'etre, you know.","She wouldn\'t even kill me. She just left. She didn\'t even care enough to cut off my head, or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared? It was the truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I\'d gone soft - wasn\'t demon enough for the likes of her.","Well, isn\'t this usually the part where you... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?","Oh, I don\'t know. Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there...it\'s an overrated pleasure.","Sorry about the chains. It\'s not that I don\'t trust you, it\'s... Actually, it is that I don\'t trust you.","I\'m just so excited. They come in, I help them, they give us money in exchange for goods, you give me money for working for you. I have a place in the world now. I\'m part of the system. I\'m a workin\' gal.","Wow, it\'s like, one second you were this klutzy teenager with false memories and a history of kleptomania, and then suddenly you were a hero. A hero with a much abbreviated life span.","You gotta give me something to do. There\'s no way I\'m sleeping. Don\'t you need anyone dead? Or maimed? I can settle for maimed.","You know, I honestly don\'t think there\'s a human word fabulous enough for me.","We don\'t know much about them except for they\'re very ugly, and they\'re very mobile for

sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!","Ray, when someone asks you if you\'re a god, you say \'YES\'!","Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!","Don\'t cross the streams.","Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.","Total protonic reversal.","Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis?","It\'s the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.","We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!","Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon... what\'ve you got left?","Sorry, Venkman, I\'m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.","Why worry? Each one of us is carrying an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.","There is no Dana, there is only Zuul.","Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.","You\'re very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.","Oh, that\'s very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I\'m too intellectual but I think it\'s a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies?","I collect spores, molds, and fungus.","Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?","Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?","Have you or your family ever seen a spook, spectre or ghost?","Our courteous and efficient staff is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs.","We\'re ready to believe you.","That\'s the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there.","You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!","We\'d like to get a sample of your brain tissue.","Gozer the Gozerian... good evening. As a duly designated representative of the City, County and State of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.","I am the Keymaster! The Destructor is coming. Gozer the Traveler, the Destroyer.","I am Vinz, Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?","Hey, he pulls the wagon, I made the deals. You want a ride?","Wait for the sign. Then our prisoners will be released.","You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!","If I\'m wrong, nothing happens! We go to jail - peacefully, quietly. We\'ll enjoy it! But if I\'m *right*, and we *can* stop this thing... Lenny, you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.","The whole building is a huge, superconductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse... of Spook Central.","She\'s not my girlfriend. I find her interesting because she\'s a client and because she sleeps above her covers... FOUR FEET above her covers. She barks, she drools, she claws!","Listen... you smell something?","I\'m Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor. I\'ve only been with the company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I joined these men, I\'ve seen shit that\'ll turn you white.","Somebody blows their nose and wanna keep it?","I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft!","Some are people who just want attention. Others, just nutballs who come in off the street.","Generally you don\'t see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.","Hello, Ghostbusters... Yes, of course they\'re serious... You do?... You have?... No kidding! Just gimme the address... Oh sure, they will be totally discreet. Thank you!","I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.","As they say in T.V., I\'m sure there\'s one big question on everybody\'s mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?","Hee hee hee! \'Get her!\'\' That was your whole plan, huh, \'get her.\' Very scientific.","OK... so... she\'s a dog...","Ray, pretend for a moment that I don\'t know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.","I\'m gonna take back some of the things I said about you, Egon.","Tell him about the Twinkie.","Sir, what you had there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm or a class-five full-roaming vapor. A real nasty one, too.","Coming through! One class-five full-roaming vapor. Move \'em out.","Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it! Now, are we actually gonna go before a federal judge, and tell him that some moldy Babylonian god is going to drop in on Central Park West, and start tearing up the city?","You know, you don\'t act like a scientist.","You\'re more like a game show host.","Well, this is great. If the ionization-rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we can really bust some heads... in a spiritual sense, of course.","I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.","Some moron brought a cougar to a party and it went berserk.","And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep, she thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn\'t the first.","I think this building should be condemned. There\'s serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring is substandard, it\'s completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.","Wow. This place is great. When can we move in? You gotta try this pole. I\'m gonna get my stuff. Hey. We should stay here. Tonight. Sleep here. You know, to try it out.","Venkman, shorten your stream! I don\'t want my face burned off!","He slimed me.","I\'m studying the effects of negative reinforcement on ESP ability","Let\'s say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According to this morning\'s sample, it would be a twinkie... 35 feet long and weighing approximately 600 pounds.","That\'s a big Twinkie.","We could on the verge of a fourfold cross-reap. A P.K.E. surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions!","Of course you forget, Peter. I was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.","Uhhh... this magnificent feast here represents the LAST of the petty cash.","Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman!","I think we can get her a guest shot on \'Wild Kingdom.\' I just whacked her up with about 300 cc\'s of Thorazaine... she\'s gonna take a little nap now.","Everybody can relax, I found the car. Needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end.","Maybe now you\'ll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?","So, what are we doing today, Zuul?","We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.","We\'ve neutronized it, you know what that means? A complete particle reversal.","We have the tools, and we have the talent!","Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys. The whole island\'s going crazy. Let\'s go.","The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.","Nobody ever made them like this! The architect was either a certified genius, or an authentic wacko.","Nice thinking, Ray.","It\'s true, your honor. The man is some kind of rodent, I don\'t know which.","Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?","Nice doggy. Cute little pooch.

But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and bitter. Wait. It\'s not love I\'m describing. I\'m thinking of a monorail.","Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won\'t bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.","It\'s interesting to think that my ancestors used to live in the trees, like apes, until finally they got the nerve to head out onto the plains, where some were probably hit by cars.","Instead of having \\"answers\\" on a math test, they should just call them \\"impressions,\\" and if you got a different \\"impression,\\" so what, can\'t we all be brothers?","If they ever come up with a swashbuckling school, I think one of the courses should be laughing, then jumping off something.","I can\'t stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone says something like, \\"Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100 you owe me?\\" or \\"Do you have that $50 you borrowed?\\" Man, quit being so cheap!","Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even if you don\'t know what your rights are, or who the person is you\'re talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door.","We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can\'t scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.","Somebody told me it was frightening how much topsoil we are losing each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got scared.","The difference between a man and a boy is, a boy wants to grow up to be a fireman, but a man wants to grow up to be a giant monster fireman.","If any man says he hates war more than I do, he better have a knife, that\'s all I have to say.","If God dwells inside us like some people say, I sure hope He likes enchiladas, because that\'s what He\'s getting.","Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that I forgot to put on my pants.","If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins most? I\'d say Flippy, wouldn\'t you? You\'d be wrong though. It\'s Hambone.","Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that\'s like a regular window.","When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if they ever press charges.","If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.","One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, never run with a wooden stake.","Laurie got offended that I used the word \\"puke.\\" But to me, that\'s what her dinner tasted like.","If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you\'ll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.","When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we\'d all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn\'t until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.","To me, it\'s a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, \\"Hey, can you give me a hand?\\" You can say, \\"Sorry, got these sacks.\\"","If you\'re robbing a bank and your pants fall down, I think it\'s okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny.","Whenever you read a good book, it\'s like the author is right there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don\'t like to read good books.","If you lose your job, your marriage and your mind all in one week, try to lose your mind first, because then the other stuff won\'t matter that much.","I wish I had a kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula and Superman away.","Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have.","Any man, in the right situation, is capable of murder.

Hey, better try the emergency brake.","One day one of my little nephews came up to me and asked me if the equator was a real line that went around the Earth, or just an imaginary one. I had to laugh. Laugh and laugh. Because I didn\'t know, and I thought that maybe by laughing he would forget what he asked me."],"matz":["I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.","From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.","The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.","I didn\'t work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it\'s not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.","Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.","Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.","You want to enjoy life, don\'t you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that\'s good isn\'t it? That\'s the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.","People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that\'s what I\'ve tried to do.","In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use.","Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.","Actually, I didn\'t make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn\'t bring that up, actually.","Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.","Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, \'My language is perfect. It can do everything.\' But it\'s just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming.","I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.","Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.","I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.","Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while I\'m not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.","It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but the language should make good looking code possible.","Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.","Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.","Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.","Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, \'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.\' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only.","Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, its best, isn\'t it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs. Python people say that too."],"mitch_hedberg":["An escalator can never break, it can only become stairs. You should never see an \'Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order\' sign, just \'Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience\'.","I\'m sick of following my dreams. I\'m just going to ask them where they\'re goin\', and hook up with them later.","Is a hippopotamus a hippopotamus, or just a really cool Opotamus?","I don\'t have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who\'d be mad at me for saying that.","I was at this casino minding my own business, and this guy came up to me and said, \'You\'re gonna have to move, you\'re blocking a fire exit.\' As though if there was a fire, I wasn\'t gonna run. If you\'re flammible and have legs, you are never blocking a fire exit.","Rice is great if you\'re really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something.","My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen banana. I said \'No, but I want a regular banana later, so... yeah.\'","My belt holds my pants up, but the belt loops hold my belt up. I don\'t really know what\'s happening down there. Who is the real hero?","I wanted to buy a candle holder, but the store didn\'t have one. So I got a cake.","I haven\'t slept for ten days, because that would be too long.","I like refried beans. That\'s why I wanna try fried beans, because maybe they\'re just as good and we\'re just wasting time.","Y\'know, you can\'t please all the people all the time... and last night, all those people were at my show.","Fettucini alfredo is macaroni and cheese for adults.","I bought a seven-dollar pen because I always lose pens and I got sick of not caring.","I want to get a vending machine, with fun sized candy bars, and the glass in front is a magnifying glass. You\'ll be mad, but it will be too late.","This shirt is dry clean only. Which means it\'s dirty.","If carrots got you drunk, rabbits would be messed-up.","The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I\'ll never be as good as a wall.","I\'m against picketing, but I don\'t know how to show it.","I like to play blackjack. I\'m not addicted to gambling. I\'m addicted to sitting in a semi-circle.","Every time I go and shave, I assume there\'s someone else on the planet shaving. So I say, \'I\'m gonna go shave, too.\'","I recently took up ice sculpting. Last night I made an ice cube. This morning I made 12, I was prolific.","I would imagine that if you could understand Morse code, a tap dancer would drive you crazy.","I had a stick of CareFree gum, but it didn\'t work.

She does live in a trailer. She got halfway. She\'s an actress, she just never gets called to the set.","I\'d like to get four people who do cart wheels very good, and make a cart.","If my kid couldn\'t draw I\'d make sure that my kitchen magnets didn\'t work.","I saw a human pyramid once. It was very unnecessary.","People teach their dogs to sit; it\'s a trick. I\'ve been sitting my whole life, and a dog has never looked at me as though he thought I was tricky.","I wish my name was Brian because maybe sometimes people would misspell my name and call me Brain. That\'s like a free compliment and you don\'t even gotta be smart to notice it.","It\'s very dangerous to wave to people you don\'t know because what if they don\'t have hands? They\'ll think you\'re cocky.","I like Kit-Kats, unless I\'m with four or more people.","Dogs are forever in the push up postion.","I wish I could play little league now. I\'d be way better than before.","When someone hands you a flyer, it\'s like they\'re saying here you throw this away.","I once saw a forklift lift a crate of forks.

I need to have sex with women who have saved someone\'s life.","I wear a necklace, cause I wanna know when I\'m upside down.","You know when they have a fishing show on TV?

Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.","For dessert, we ordered the chocolate drizzled churros and they were delicious too! They even came with some fresh fruit (blueberries and strawberries).","Overall, the evening was a smash and I am so glad there is a new location closer to my office!!","Brand new. Great design. Odd to hear pop music in a Mexican establishment. Music is a bit loud. It should be background.","The chicken nachos were delicious and the atmosphere was great. The frozen margaritas were a little on the weak side. Would probably return for a work happy hour but was pretty disappointed about the lack of free tequila and beer we read about!","The counter is on the left side, and so is the menu. It can get pretty busy with 30 min wait times. I recommend checking the website and see how busy their store is.","They are way understaffed, where the cashier needs to stop taking orders to help pack to-go orders. The line ends up piling up and people are neglected.  Seen this happen multiple times during lunch hours.","This particular location like the many other restaurants down the block has ample seating and a second floor.","I first heard about this place through Instagram post. The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!","Great place to stop in from a chaotic Times Square adventure! The coffee is great, the drinks are creative and the staff is very nice and hospitable. Cant wait to stop in again. Without a doubt 5 stars from me!!","Great lattes and cold drinks as well. Nice to see a place carrying local coffee and products in Times Square! Excited to make it a part of my morning commute as it is much less crowded than the chain coffee shops around here.","Fish was high quality but portions were small. $57 for 9 pieces and a hand roll which is fair but on the expensive side.","Ambience was good, service was no nonsense but friendly.","Id have to say that each piece was fresh and had their own slight unique flavor twist to it, pushing the line between traditional edomae and fusion. The Hokkaido uni and the ocean trout topped with cook seaweed was the highlights of the meal. But each piece served was really something special.","Staff was very accommodating but the chef were no nonsense. The ambiance is clean and tranquil which is perfect if youre looking to have a conversation with a date or a friend.","My only critique would be that the rice could of used more vingaer and for them to use real wasabi. Also the variety of fish in stock wasnt a lot but hopefully that can change over time. The cost justify the quality youre getting.

Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone\'s death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn\'t there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who\'s to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you\'re looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn\'t be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you\'ve seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.","I know there\'s no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don\'t care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don\'t think I\'ll live much longer and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I\'ll ever write, and god, I\'m writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1985, I don\'t remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain. My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl\'s grammar; it was at school that I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful. I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn\'t. In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents. I couldn\'t have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn\'t look at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that inch, we are free. I\'d always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015 I starred in my first film, \'The Salt Flats\'. It was the most important role of my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years of my life. But America\'s war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London. After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like \'collateral\' and \'rendition\' became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don\'t understand it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I\'ve never cried so hard in my life. It wasn\'t long till they came for me. It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years, I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie","Listen to me, Evey. This may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it. They took your parents from you. They took your brother from you. They put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life. And you believed that was all there was, didn\'t you? The only thing you had left was your life, but it wasn\'t, was it? You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you\'d rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still. Try to feel now what you felt then.","My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.","Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He\'s a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of \'national security\'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary\'s crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.","Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I\'ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I\'ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.","So I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco. A gesture, they said, of good will. You wanna know what I think? Well, you\'re listening to my show, so I will assume you do... I think it\'s high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them. I think its payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago. I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica belongs! Who\'s with me? Who\'s bloody with me? Did you like that? USA... Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica, I mean what else can you say? Here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything. And now, 20 years later, is what? The world\'s biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn\'t the war they started. It wasn\'t the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he\'s not up there? You think he\'s not watching over this country? How else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through. We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go. Strength through unity. Unity through faith. I\'m a God-fearing Englishman and I\'m goddamn proud of it!","Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it\'s my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."]},"vehicle":{"car_options":["A/C: Front","Airbag:
